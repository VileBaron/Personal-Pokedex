When  I started this project I was new to JavaScript, AJAX, and API.  I used all these tools to help me build a Pokemon Pokedex.  Once I started playing around with the codes, I noticed that it was very powerful and I could do a lot of intresting things with the concept.  I decided to pick a very dark theme, becaue I find darkness very intresting in cute creatures.  This is the concept I came up with.
